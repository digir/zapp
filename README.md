# Project Scaffolder 🛠️

A **language/framework-agnostic CLI tool** to quickly bootstrap your project structure with customisable templates.


## Why This Exists

Starting new projects often involves repetitive setup:
- Creating the same folder structure
- Writing similar config files
- Copy-pasting boilerplate code

This CLI lets you create **reusable templates** for any tech stack (React, Python, Go, etc.), so you can focus on writing actual code from day one.

## Features ✨

- 📂 Generate project structures from templates
- 🔧 Supports variables (e.g., `{{project_name}}`)
- 🌐 Works with any language/framework
- 🔄 Update existing projects from templates
